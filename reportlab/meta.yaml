  summary: The ReportLab Toolkit
  description: |
    The ReportLab toolkit is a collection of open source Python language
    modules organised and supported by ReportLab. The modules are primarily
    concerned with automating methods for generating Portable Document Format
    (PDF) files, but there is also a cross-platform vector graphics library
    able to generate bitmap and vector charts and drawings.
