  description: |
    Dill extends Python's 'pickle' module for serializing and de-serializing
    Python objects to he majority of the built-in python types. Serialization
    is the process of converting an object to a byte stream, and the inverse of
    which is converting a byte stream back to on python object hierarchy.
