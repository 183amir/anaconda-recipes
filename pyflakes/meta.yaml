  summary: Checks Python source files for errors
  description: |
    Pyflakes is similar to PyChecker in scope, but differs in that it does not
    execute the modules to check them. This is both safer and faster, although
    it does not perform as many checks. Unlike PyLint, Pyflakes checks only
    for logical errors in programs; it does not perform any check on style.
