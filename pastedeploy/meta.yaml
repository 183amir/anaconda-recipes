  summary: Load, configure, and compose WSGI applications and servers
  description: |
    Paste Deployment is a system for finding and configuring WSGI applications
    and servers. For WSGI application consumers it provides a single, simple
    function (loadapp) for loading a WSGI application from a configuration file
    or a Python Egg. For WSGI application providers it only asks for a single,
    simple entry point to your application, so that application users don't
    need to be exposed to the implementation details of your application.
