  summary: A compiler that integrates C and C++ with a variety of languages
  description: |
    SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and C++
    with scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. It works by
    taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using them to
    generate the wrapper code that scripting languages need to access the
    underlying C/C++ code.
