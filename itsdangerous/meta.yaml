  summary: Various helpers to pass trusted data to untrusted environments
  description: |
    Sometimes you just want to send some data to untrusted environments. But how to do this safely? The trick involves signing. Given a key only you know, you can cryptographically sign your data and hand it over to
    someone else. When you get the data back you can easily ensure that nobody
    tampered with it.
