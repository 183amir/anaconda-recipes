  summary: Launch jobs, organize the output, and dissect the results
  description: |
    Lancet is designed to help you organize the output of your research tools,
    store it, and dissect the data you have collected. The output of a single
    simulation run or analysis rarely contains all the data you need; Lancet
    helps you generate data from many runs and analyse it using your own
    Python code.
