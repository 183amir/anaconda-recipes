  summary: Declarative Python programming using Parameters
  description: |
    Param is a library providing Parameters: Python attributes extended to
    have features such as type and range checking, dynamically generated
    values, documentation strings, default values, etc., each of which is
    inherited from parent classes if not specified in a subclass. Param lets
    you program declaratively in Python, by just stating facts about each of
    your parameters, and then using them throughout your code.
