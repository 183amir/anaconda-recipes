  summary: Python code static checker
  description: |
    Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a
    coding standard and looks for bad code smells. This is similar but
    nevertheless different from what pychecker provides, especially since
    pychecker explicitly does not bother with coding style.
